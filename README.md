Abstract:
Tourism is a significant contributor to climate change, primarily due to carbon emissions from flights, cruise ships, and other forms of transportation. As environmental awareness grows, so does the demand for sustainable travel solutions. However, there is a gap in the market for an all-in-one platform that helps travelers plan eco-friendly trips without sacrificing convenience or experience.

Our project aims to address this issue by developing a web-based eco-travel platform that empowers users to plan and book sustainable travel experiences. The platform offers tools for calculating the environmental impact of different travel options, suggests greener alternatives, and connects users with eco-conscious accommodations and activities. Key features include a Carbon Footprint Calculator, and Eco-Conscious Accommodation Finder all designed to promote greener travel choices while maintaining the quality of the travel experience.
